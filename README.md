This paper presents a theoretical framework unifying three fundamental physical constants: the
gravitational constant (G), Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence (E=mc²), and the fine structure
constant (α). Through dimensional analysis and theoretical modeling, we propose novel
relationships with implications for advanced propulsion and energy generation systems. We
introduce a dimensionless coupling constant β that suggests possible connections between
gravitational and electromagnetic interactions, β = (GE²)/(αc⁶r²).
